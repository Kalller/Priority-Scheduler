# Priority Scheduler for Educational C-Based Operating System 


This repository contains an implementation of a **priority-based scheduler** designed for operating systems written in C, in this case PintOS. The scheduler manages multiple processes or threads, assigning CPU time based on their priority level. This project is ideal for learning, experimentation, or as a base for further operating system or embedded systems development.

## Features

- **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Processes/threads are assigned priorities; higher-priority tasks are scheduled before lower-priority ones.

- Run the tests:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Go to the "pintos/src/threads" project folder:
cd pintos/src/threads

3. Build the "threads" project:

Do this

4. Run all tests:

Check

From now on, QEMU will automatically start for each test. When you see the 'Powering off...' screen, you must close QEMU and continue until the tests are complete.
